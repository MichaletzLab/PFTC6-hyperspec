# PFTC6 data paper README file (dataset iii)

This repository contains the cleaning code for the handheld hyperspectral measurements (dataset iii) from the data paper: Vandvik et al.Â Plant trait, carbon flux, reflectance and climate data from global change experiments and gradients in Norway.

**This repository contains:**

- raw data 

- code to clean the data and create clean data files

- code to create tables and figures showing sample sizes at each site, and variation in hyperspectral reflectance across sites, species and wavelengths

### Reproduce the cleaning code


To reproduce the cleaning code follow these steps:
1. Download this repository
2. Open the Rproject file
3. Run the script 01_cleaning.R
